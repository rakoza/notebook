# The PHAR Installation and Verification Environment (PHIVE)

https://phar.io/

> Install phar distributed PHP applications with easy.

### How it works

PHIVE makes installation easy by providing a means to resolve the given alias to an actual download location, including the verification of the certificate supplied by the server. Once downloaded, the archiveâ€™s SHA1, SHA256 or SHA512 hash is verified as well as its OpenPGP/GnuPG signature.

Instead of re-downloading the same phar multiple times, the archive is kept at a shared location (by default in ~/.phive) and only a symbolic link is created for the project. You can of course also explicitly request a copy of the phar to be made in favor of symbolic links (use --copy).

### Installation
```sh
wget -O phive.phar https://phar.io/releases/phive.phar
wget -O phive.phar.asc https://phar.io/releases/phive.phar.asc
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 0x9D8A98B29B2D5D79
gpg --verify phive.phar.asc phive.phar
chmod +x phive.phar
sudo mv phive.phar /usr/local/bin/phive
```

### Usage
```sh
# List all available packages
phive list
# List all installed packages
phive status --all
# Install psalm
phive install psalm
```


```sh
# Install using phar.io registered alias
phive install phpunit
# Install using github <name>/<repository>
phive install theseer/Autoload
# Ignore security implications and install unsigned phar via github <name>/<repository>
phive install --force-accept-unsigned vendor/unsigned-project
# Install using a fixed url
phive install https://phar.phpunit.de/phpunit-7.3.5.phar
# When used in CI environments - specify trusted keys and suppress progress output
phive --no-progress install --trust-gpg-keys 4AA394086372C20A,2A8299CE842DD38C phpab phpunit
# Create a copy of the phar rather than using a symlink
phive install --copy phpdox
# Install a phar with a specified version constraint
phive install psalm@^4.1.1
# Use ./build/tools directory rather than default ./tools as symlink target folder
phive install --target ./build/tools phpdox
# Install all phar files declared in phive.xml
phive install
```
